# udacity-redux-todo_app

## With this app you can:

- add todo and goal items
- will not allow you to add an item wich contains the word "bitcoin"
- remove todo and goal items
- click on todo item and mark as done

## In index.html file is the implementation of the redux-todo-app

## On this branch, in the react-redux-goals-todos folder is the same app, refactored with create-react-app.

### In order to organize the individual elements of the app the "Rails-style" approach was used. That is, assets are grouped by "type" or "capability": any action will be found in the Actions folder, any reducer will be found in Reducers, and so on.
