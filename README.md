# To-Do Goals Project

This project is my implementation of To-Do Goals app which is a code along project for the
Udacity's React Redux course, part of the [React Nanodegree Program](https://udacity.com/course/nd019).

## With this app you can:

- add todo and goal items
- will not allow you to add an item wich contains the word "bitcoin"
- remove todo and goal items
- click on todo item and mark as done

---

### > In index.html file is the implementation of the redux-todo-app

### > In the react-redux-goals-todos folder is the same app, refactored with create-react-app.

#### In order to organize the individual elements of the app the "Rails-style" approach was used. That is, assets are grouped by "type" or "capability": any action will be found in the Actions folder, any reducer will be found in Reducers, and so on.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

- **Npm** is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- **Yarn** is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general. [Download Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
